# Jose Miguel Rozo Baez

Senior Software Engineer specialized in Distributed Systems, Cloud Infrastructure (Azure), and Automation.

I have over 6 years of experience engineering scalable solutions for multinational corporations like Nokia and SLB. My focus is on backend architecture, CI/CD pipelines, and modernizing legacy systems.

## Portfolio Context

The majority of my professional work resides in private enterprise repositories (Azure DevOps / GitLab) under strict Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). I cannot share code related to the $1M+ savings automation projects or critical infrastructure migrations I have led.

However, I am actively building open-source tooling to demonstrate my current engineering capabilities and interest in new technologies.

## Featured Project

**Employment Agent (PoC)**
I am currently developing a Python-based automation tool that scrapes, analyzes, and filters job opportunities using LLMs. This project demonstrates my ability to work with Python, APIs, and data processing outside of the .NET ecosystem.
